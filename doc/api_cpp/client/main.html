<h1>BigWorld Client documentation</h1>
<p>
<br>
 This is the API reference documentation for the client portion of the <b>BigWorld Toolkit</b>.<h2><a class="anchor" name="intro">
Introduction to BigWorld technology</a></h2>
The BigWorld Client provides the end-user experience of a MMOG, displaying the 3D scene and running some local game logic.<p>
The scene displayed is a combination of static world geometry stored on the client platform, and dynamic data sent from the server (entities such as other players and monsters). The user interacts with the world through an avatar. The movement and actions of that avatar are relayed to the server. The avatars controlled by other connected users are part of the dynamic data sent from the server.<p>
See the <b>Client Programming Guide</b> for a full description of how the BigWorld Client works and more details on programming for it.<p>
